# Stater template for JSX (React) projects
This template provides config examples for Grunt and Gulp to allow you to develop ReactJS applications. This is barebones configuration and will require you to adapt to your own project paths etc.

Out of the box this template combines the `.jsx` files located in `_src\jsx\` folder, uses `babel` to convert the JSX into JavaScript and outputs the file to `app.js` in `build\assets\js`

To begin install the dependencies.
```
npm install
```
This will install Grunt and Gulp dependencies. To change your configuration edit the `gruntfile.js` or `gulpfile.js` file, depending on which build tool you wish to use.
